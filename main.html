	  <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	  <p>Time Complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps measure the efficiency of an algorithm and predicts how quickly it will run depending on the input.</p>
	  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It is usually expressed using Big O notation, like O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input.</p>
