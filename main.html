	  <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	  <p>Time complexity helps measure how efficient an algorithm is by estimating the amount of time it takes to run as the input size increases. Lower time complexity generally means a more efficient.</p>
	  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For Example, if a programs take an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program become 0(n).</p>
